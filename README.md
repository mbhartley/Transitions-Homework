CSS Transitions- The Iron Yard Academy Week One

After the initial lecture on CSS Transitions, I was given the following assignment: create 15 examples of CSS 
Transitions. This was a very enjoyable assignment for me. For the first time ever, I began to see the 'power' of
programming unleashed in easily executable animation effects. I'm still captivated by the idea of such simple
animation, and I definitely hope to be able to re-visit the topic after the end of the course. Mastery of CSS
is definitely a direction I hope my career will eventually lead me.
